By default, `get-filehash` command will generate SHA256 sum of a file,

```powershell
get-filehash <file>
```

To generate MD5 hash of a file,

```powershell

```

To generate SHA1 hash of a file,

```powershell
get-filehash -algorithm SHA1 <file>
```

- **Linux** -

- Capture and view the browser history with 
	- **Browser History Viewer** 
	- **Browser History Capturer**

6. **Linux Investigations** :
	- **/etc/passwd** - contains all information about users in the system. 
	- **/etc/shadow** - contains encrypted passwords
	- **Unshadow** - used to combine the passwd and shadow files.
	- **/var/lib** - In `/var/lib/dpkg/status` location, this file includes a list of all installed software packages.
	- **.bash_history** - contains all the issued commands by the users.
	- **Hidden Files** - isuch files whose name begins with **.**
	- **Clear Files** - files that are accessible through standard means.
	- **Steganography** - practice of concealing messages or information within other non-secret text or data.

7. **Volatility** - 

Find the imageinfo of the file, 

```bash
volatility -f /path/to/file.mem imageinfo
```

List the processes of a system,

```bash
volatility -f /path/to/file.mem --profile=PROFILE pslist
```

View the process listing in tree form,

```bash
volatility -f /path/to/file.mem --profile=PROFILE pstree
```

View command line of the specific process with PID XXXX,

```bash
volatility -f /path/to/file.mem --profile=PROFILE dlllist -p XXXX
```

View Network Connections,

```bash
volatility -f /path/to/file.mem --profile=PROFILE netscan
```

Dumping the process with a specific PID XXXX,

```bash
volatility -f /path/to/file.mem --profile=PROFILE procdump -p XXXX -D /home/ubuntu/Desktop
```

Print all available processes,

```bash
volatility -f memdump.mem --profile=PROFILE psscan
```

Print expected and hidden processes,

```bash
volatility -f memdump.mem --profile=PROFILE psxview
```

Create a timeline of events from the memory image,

```bash
volatility -f memdump.mem --profile=PROFILE timeliner
```

Pull internet browsing history,

```bash
volatility -f memdump.mem --profile=PROFILE iehistory
```

Identify any files on the system from the memory image,

```bash
volatility -f memdump.mem --profile=PROFILE filescan
```

8. **Metadata** - Data about data
	
- **Exiftool** 

```bash
exiftool <file>
```

## Security Information and Event Management

### SPLUNK

Queries must start by referencing the dataset,

```md
index="botsv1"
```

To search for a source IP (src) address with a value of 127.0.0.1,

```md
index="botsv1" src="127.0.0.1"
```

To search for a destination IP (dst) address that this source IP address made a connection with a value of X.X.X.X,

```md
index="botsv1" src="127.0.0.1" dst="X.X.X.X"
```

## Incident Response

1. **Network Analysis** - use Wireshark to import .pcap, .pcapng files.

2. **CMD** : Command prompt can be used to view the valuable information,

To view the network configuration of the system,

```cmd
ipconfig /all
```

To check running processes and programs,

```cmd
tasklist
```

Display running processes and the associated binary file that was executed to create the process,

```cmd
wmic process get description, executablepath
```

To view all number of users in the command prompt

```cmd
net users
```

List all users that are in the administrators user group,

```cmd
net localgroup administrators
```

List all users in RDP group,

```cmd
net localgroup "Remote Desktop Users"
```

List all services and detailed information about each one,

```cmd
sc query | more
```

List open ports on a system, which could show the presence of a backdoor,

```cmd
netstat -ab
```

3. **Powershell** - Can also be used often retrieve much more information.

These commands will get network-related information from the system,

```powershell
Get-NetIPConfiguration
Get-NetIPAddress
```

List all local users on the system,

```powershell
Get-LocalUser
```

Provide a specific user to the command to only get information about them,

```powershell
Get-LocalUser -Name BTLO | select *
```

Quickly identify running services on the system in a nice separate window,

```powershell
Get-Service | Where Status -eq "Running" | Out-GridView
```

Group running processes by their priority value,

```powershell
Get-Process | Format-Table -View priority
```

Collect specific information from a service by including the name in the command (-Name ‘namehere’) or the Id, as shown above and below,

```powershell
Get-Process -Id 'idhere' | Select *
```

Scheduled Tasks are often abused and utilized a common persistence technique,

```powershell
Get-ScheduledTask
```

Specify the task, and retrieving all properties for it,

```powershell
Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'PutANameHere' | Select *
```

Changing the Execution Policy applied to our user,

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser
```

4. **DeepBlueCLI** - PowerShell script that was created by SANS to aid with the investigation and triage of Windows Event logs.

To process log.evtx,

```powershell
./DeepBlue.ps1 log.evtx
```

DeepBlue will point at the local system's Security or System event logs directly,

```powershell
# Start the Powershell as Administrator and navigate into the DeepBlueCli tool directory, and run the script

./DeepBlue.ps1 -log security
./DeepBlue.ps1 -log system

# if the script is not running, then we need to bypass the execution policy
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser
```
